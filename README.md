# Dynamic-Memory-Management

In developing the Memory Management System in C, I gained experience in dynamic memory management. I used the memory allocation function "calloc()" to dynamically allocate memory blocks to store integers. I also learned how to check for successful memory allocation and handle errors when allocation fails. Additionally, I implemented functions to set and get values at specified indexes in the allocated memory block. 
Finally, I learned how to free dynamically allocated memory to avoid memory leaks.
